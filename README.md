# TurtleBot 3 Color Line Following Robot

## Overview
This project involves developing a color line-following robot using ROS2, Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu, and OpenCV on a TurtleBot 3 platform. The robot is equipped to detect and follow a colored line on the ground, utilizing computer vision techniques for real-time image processing. The Raspberry Pi, mounted on the TurtleBot 3, handles the image capture and processing, enabling the robot to autonomously navigate along the line.

### Key Features:
- **ROS2 Integration**: Manages robot movement control , ensuring smooth operation and coordination of the TurtleBot 3.
- **TurtleBot 3**: The robot is built on the TurtleBot 3 platform, which provides mobility and sensor capabilities.
- **Computer Vision with OpenCV**: Implements OpenCV to detect and track the colored line, allowing for real-time adjustments and path following.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the primary processing unit, running Ubuntu and handling the vision processing tasks.
